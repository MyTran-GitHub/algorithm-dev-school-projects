# Algorithm-dev school projects
This includes school projects related to data structure and algorithms, software development, etc

## What I have so far:
- **Design task scheduler** :calendar:: I use Python to design a Task scheduler based on the task's utility. To understand the problem in depth, I explored different ways to design a task scheduler, including designing both a single-task system and a multitasking system and using different algorithmic strategies such as priority queue, dynamic programming and greedy algorithm. I compared the pros, cons, and time complexity of each approach.
